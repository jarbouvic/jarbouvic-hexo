- Quiet. I love quiet. And music. This is what saves my soul. Leave me alone for a few hours, I'll love you for it.
- AI. I'm fascinated by it. I never stepped seriously into it, don't know why really. Seems that AI is becoming a reality during this era. I'd love to be part of it.
- Coffee. I need it. Every day. Please.
- The web. I've been on it since 56k modems. It's my favorite lego box.
- My family. My wife. My kids. But hey you've got that already.
