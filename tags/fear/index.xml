      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trump just won. Unexpected. Sad. Feeling the world nosediving in darkness. But music will save us all. Trump is just a puppet. Appealing to all those who want a break. Appealing to those who live on hope. He&amp;rsquo;s just a man. Delured yes, but just a man. How&amp;rsquo;s he gonna break all of us? Just a man really. Although most powerful now. But music will save him too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised first. Then really waiting for shock to come in. It never did. We are our world. We want a Trump. You want it. I want it. We&amp;rsquo;re not rational really. My mind cries. My heart hopes. But somewhere deep, we&amp;rsquo;re all in for it. Trump&amp;rsquo;s just a man. Brexit&amp;rsquo;s just a word. They hurt, yes. But we want them. We live by them. We crave for change. Middle finger to all. We&amp;rsquo;re lost in life. But we&amp;rsquo;ve got music. Now. Hope sings in our hears. We live. We feel. It will save us.&lt;/p&gt;
