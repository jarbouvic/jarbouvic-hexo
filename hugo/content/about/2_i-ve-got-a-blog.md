If you look further, you might read a few things I wrote since I was in college. Mostly personal stuff, random thoughts and the occasional rumbling. Don't look for something structured or meaningful, it's mostly a fragmented piece of myself hanging out in the interwebs. I keep it there because I'm sentimental and I wish to dedicate more time to blogging in the future. By the way, I'm french, so if some of it sounds french to you, well that's normal.
