I'm Victor. I live currently in Jakarta, Indonesia. I'm passionate about software but my family comes first. I'm currently on a break to raise my two kids: the youngest is learning to scribble on the wall, the oldest is starting to read. When I'm not changing diapers, I write code. It's hard to find the right balance between kids and code, but I aim to develop my skills at both.
